I. Selenium WebDriver Fundamentals

Core Concepts:

Explain the Selenium WebDriver architecture.
========================================================================
What is the difference between findElement and findElements methods?
Let's break down the key differences between findElement and findElements methods in Selenium WebDriver:

findElement

Purpose: Retrieves the first matching web element on a page according to the specified locator strategy (e.g., ID, CSS selector, XPath).
Return Value:
Success: Returns a single WebElement object.
Failure: Throws a NoSuchElementException if no matching element is found.
Use Cases: Situations where you are confident there should only be one unique element matching your criteria, such as:
Interacting with the login button
Clicking on a specific product title.
findElements

Purpose: Finds all web elements on a page that match the provided locator strategy.
Return Value:
Success: A List of WebElement objects. The list might be empty if no matches are found.
Failure: Does not throw an exception if no elements are found. It returns an empty list.
Use Cases: Ideal when you need to deal with multiple matching elements:
Getting all items in a search result list
Finding all checkboxes on a form
Iterating through navigation menu links
=================================================================================================
Describe how you handle dynamic elements using Selenium.
Dynamic elements in a web page often have attributes (IDs, names, classes, etc.) that change with each page load or user interaction.  This makes traditional locators unreliable and prone to breaking tests.

Effective Strategies

Reliable Attribute Selection:

Partial Matches: Use parts of dynamic attributes with strategies like:
contains(): Match elements containing a specific text substring.
starts-with(): Match elements with attributes starting with a certain prefix.
ends-with(): Match elements with attributes ending in a specified suffix.
Relative XPaths: Locate elements based on their position relative to stable parent or sibling elements.
Waiting Mechanisms:   Introduce waits to pause execution until the dynamic element appears or meets some expected state.

Explicit Waits: Provide specific conditions to wait for:
visibilityOfElementLocated(): Wait for an element to be visible.
elementToBeClickable(): Wait for an element to be both visible and clickable.
Fluent Waits: More customizable waits, allowing you to set additional conditions like polling frequency and ignoring certain exceptions.
Stable Parent-Child Relationships:  Build locators that traverse down from a static parent element that's reliably locatable to then find the dynamic child element.

Index-Based Access: If elements are within an identifiable structure (like a list), sometimes their relative position is stable. Exercise caution, as changes in the structure can break this approach.

Leverage Unique Text Content: If  the dynamic element contains unique text, locate it by the text value.

Custom JavaScript Solutions:   When complex situations arise, write JavaScript code to dynamically locate elements and return them to your Selenium script.
================================================================
Differentiate between implicit waits, explicit waits, and fluent waits. Provide use cases for each.
