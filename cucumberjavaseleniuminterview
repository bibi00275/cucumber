I. Selenium WebDriver Fundamentals

Core Concepts:

Explain the Selenium WebDriver architecture.
What is the difference between findElement and findElements methods?
Describe how you handle dynamic elements using Selenium.
Differentiate between implicit waits, explicit waits, and fluent waits. Provide use cases for each.
How do you perform cross-browser testing with Selenium WebDriver?
Advanced Interactions:

Walk me through how you'd simulate drag-and-drop actions using Selenium.
How do you manage file uploads and downloads in Selenium tests?
What techniques do you use for handling pop-ups, alerts, and frames?
Explain strategies for capturing screenshots at different stages of test execution.
II. Java Programming Principles

OOP Concepts:

Can you illustrate Object-Oriented Programming concepts (inheritance, polymorphism, etc.) with examples relevant to Selenium test design?
How do you leverage interfaces and abstract classes to structure your Selenium automation framework?
Coding & Best Practices:

How do you organize your test data (test data management practices)?
What are some design patterns (e.g., Page Object Model) you employ for efficient and maintainable Selenium tests?
Could you provide a small coding exercise demonstrating proficiency in handling collections, string manipulation, etc.?
III. TestNG Framework

Features & Annotations:

What are the advantages of using TestNG over JUnit?
Explain the purpose of annotations like @Test, @BeforeTest, @DataProvider, etc.
Can you implement a test demonstrating test prioritization, grouping, and parameterization using TestNG?
Assertions and Reports:

How do you incorporate various assertion techniques (hard and soft asserts) with TestNG?
What strategies do you have for generating informative and customized test reports with TestNG?
IV. Cucumber (Behavior-driven Development)

Understanding BDD:

Define Behavior-driven Development (BDD) and its importance in the testing process.
How does Cucumber align with BDD principles?
Compare and contrast Cucumber with other BDD frameworks (e.g., JBehave, SpecFlow).
Gherkin & Feature Files

Explain the Gherkin syntax (Given, When, Then) with examples.
How do you organize feature files within your project structure?
How do you ensure effective collaboration on feature files between developers, testers, and business stakeholders?
Step Definitions & Execution

Walk me through the process of creating step definitions and mapping them to Gherkin scenarios.
Can you implement a simple step definition using regular expressions and data tables?
How do you debug failing Cucumber tests?
Additional Topics (Depending on Interview Level):

Continuous Integration: How have you integrated Selenium tests in a CI/CD pipeline (Jenkins, Maven, etc.)?
BDD Collaboration: Describe your experience in defining scenarios working with product owners or business analysts.
Performance Testing: Have you used Selenium for basic web application performance testing (load times, etc.)?
Cloud-based Testing: Experience with cloud-based Selenium testing platforms (e.g., Sauce Labs, BrowserStack)?
